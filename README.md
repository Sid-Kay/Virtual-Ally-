# Virtual-Ally-
Your virtual best friend that helps you with your daily tasks that might require a second opinion; making them a little more fun, and a little less mundane.

**Problem Statement:**
I love a lot of random things — like architecture, fashion, 90s romcoms, desi aesthetics, workouts, and little cute games.
But every time I wanted help with any of these, I had to use different apps or ask different people.
Like:
“What should I wear today?”
“Give me a quick workout please.”
“Recommend a movie I’ll actually like.”

I wanted ONE single agent that feels like a friendly, slightly filmi, desi-vibed assistant who can do all of this for me in one place.
That’s how this idea happened.

**Solution Statement:**

My solution was to build a multi-agent AI system that can act like multiple tiny specialists inside one app.
Each agent has its own role — fashion, movies, workouts, design, and even a mini-game — and a “boss agent” decides who should answer the user.
The vibe is fun, slightly nostalgic, and personal — like a 90s romcom best friend who also happens to be smart.

**Structure of the Project:**

I created 5 helper agents:
> Fashion Agent – gives outfit ideas with desi + 90s-inspired styles
> Workout Agent – suggests beginner-friendly workouts
> Movie Agent – recommends romcoms based on mood
> Creative Design Agent – generates small architecture/fashion concepts
> Mini Game Agent – simple interactive game for fun

All of these connect to a:
Main Controller Agent, which decides which sub-agent should handle the request.

There’s also memory + simple tools so the agent doesn’t forget your preferences.


**The Build:**

Honestly, I’m still pretty new to coding, so I tried to keep things simple:
>I used Python
>Everything is in one app.py file
>There's a requirements.txt so anyone can install it
>The system runs locally or inside a Kaggle Notebook
>No API keys needed, so it’s beginner-safe
>Very easy to edit if I ever want to expand it
>I built it in VSCode first, then packed it neatly so I could upload it to Kaggle and GitHub.


 **If I Had More Time**…:

I would definitely add:
  > A cute UI with buttons and themes
  > Real API integrations (YouTube, TMDB, Pinterest, etc.)
  > A more advanced memory system
  > A bigger game (something inspired by a Bollywood movie storyline)
  > Voice version of the agent
  > A “build my outfit” image generator
  > Maybe even deploy it so people can actually use it live
  > But for now, I’m still learning — and this project was honestly just me having fun while figuring out how agents work.


**Final Thoughts**:

This project helped me understand the basics of:
    > Multi-agent systems
    > Tools & memory
    > Organizing code
    > Building something from scratch
    > And most importantly: being confident even when I’m still a beginner
